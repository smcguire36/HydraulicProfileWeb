# Notice how we didn't define the class for the FormAuthenticationFilter ('authc') - it is instantiated and available already:
authc.loginUrl = /user/login.jsf



[urls]
# make sure the end-user is authenticated.  If not, redirect to the 'authc.loginUrl' above,
# and after successful authentication, redirect them back to the original account page they
# were trying to view:
/account/** = authc
